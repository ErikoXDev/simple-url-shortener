# Simple URL Shortener

Shorten URLs by assigning IDs to them.

Requires a short domain name!

### Setup

Create a .env file in your repl and add the following keys:

PASSWORD - A password so only certain people can shorten URLs (Leave empty for no password)

ID_LENGTH - A number that sets the length of your IDs. The longer the IDs the more shortened URLs you can make. Defaults to 4.
